            An orderly array of cakes sit atop cake stands as if in a baker's display
            case.Thiebaud compresses, or flattens, the space by using a simple,
            monochrome background, barely distinguishing between the wall and
            the surface on which the cakes sit, as well as employing a skewed
            perspective. This space combined with a limited palette of subdued
            pastel shades, with a few red, pink, and yellow accents, creates a
            unified composition. While most of the cakes are differently decorated,
            save the two in the center, the overall effect is
            of similarity and repetition. <br>
            The use of solid outlines and shadows on a stark background is typical
            of Thiebaud's work in the 1960s, which has much in common with
            advertising images, and its subject matter - common consumer items -
            aligns it with much of Pop Art, but its thickly applied paint sets it apart
            from much of the movement. Curator Megan Fizell writes, "The frosting
            upon Wayne Thiebaud's 1963 painting, Cakes, is so thickly applied that
            I am often tempted to reach out, run my finger along one of the perfect
            cake-tops to taste the sugary dessert." <br>
            As such, the painting exemplifies "object transference" (a term Thiebaud
            used to describe his own work), meaning that the paint literally
            mimics the element it depicts - in this case frosting.
            To further compound this tendency, American artist Sharon Cor
            recreated the painting as a still life and then photographed it.
            To achieve the look of the heavy brushstrokes, she replicated
            the effect in frosting - thus completing the cycle of imitation
            between the subject and its representation.
